Numerical solution with C#
========================================

.. warning::
   This is an *educational project* and not intended for production use. Code is not optimized and not automatized. The goal is to provide a simple and clear implementation of beam theory in C# for educational purposes.
   The code is not intended to be used in production or for any real-world applications. It is a simplified version of beam theory and does not include all the necessary features and optimizations for a production-level implementation.
