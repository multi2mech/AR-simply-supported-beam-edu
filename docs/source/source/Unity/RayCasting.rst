.. _RayCasting:

Ray Casting and interactions
====================================

Ray interaction is based on the Meta XR ray interactor :cite:`valem_youtube`. 

You need:

 - XRRayInteractor assigned to the controller
 - Collider assigned to the object
 - RayComputation.cs script to manage the ray casting and the interaction with the object.
 - One of the movemet script: ``MoveObject.cs``, ``MoveLoad.cs`` or ``MoveConstraint.cs``.
