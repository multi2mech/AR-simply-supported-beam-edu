Automatic load cases
----------------------------------
Implementation of automatic load cases for different loading scenarios. This will include:

 - Point loads
 - Distributed loads
 - Moment loads
 - Temperature effects


Automatical loading scheme
----------------------------------

Possibility to select and add new constraints and loads to the beam.

Safety evaluation
----------------------------------
Implementation of a safety evaluation module to assess the safety of the beam and coloring the beam according to the safety criteria.

 - Green: Safe
 - Yellow: Warning
 - Red: Unsafe


Stress distribution on the cross section
----------------------------------------

Implementation of a stress distribution module to visualize the stress distribution on the cross section of the beam directly from the Moment.
